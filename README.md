<!-- War Card Game
War is a simple game of chance between two players. The deck is shuffled and split in
half. Players will compare their top cards. Whoever has the highest card wins that round
and collects both of the cards and puts them at the bottom of their stack. The players
keep on cycling until the one player has all the cards. In the case of a tie, each player
puts 2(1 each) more cards into the pot. The second cards are compared and the winner gets all
the cards in the pot. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.

Simulate this game. Suits should be by C=Clubs, D=Diamonds, H=Hearts, S=Spades.
The user should be able to step through each iteration or to run all rounds and
determine the winner.


1. Create a deck of 52 cards (13 cards of each suite)
2. Shuffle the deck
3. Distribute the cards between two players (26 - 26 cards to each players)
4. Try to use oops method overloading to compare cards. -->
